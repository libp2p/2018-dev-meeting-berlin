# Participating in the Event

The libp2p Developers Meeting is an interactive event.  **We’re asking every attendee to sign up to lead at least one session.**  It’s ok if you don’t know everything about the topic you pick!  We’re all here to support each other.  The most important thing is that everyone tries his or her or their best.

There are 3 session types you can lead:  
- presentations
- poster creation groups
- protocol design discussions 

## Presentations

A presentation is a talk given by you, either a short lightning talk or a longer 30-minute deep dive.  You will present to the group on a topic where you have high knowledge that you want to transfer to the group.

➡️ To sign up to give a presentation, please [create a new Issue](https://github.com/libp2p/developer-meetings/issues/new) in this repo with your talk title, length and abstract.

## Poster Creation Groups

These sessions consist on gathering people into small groups (2~3) and explore and understand in depth one of the selected topics before hand. At the end of the session, everyone should have a poster ready (this will be fun!) and present it to the rest of the group. 

These topics will be pre selected (pre proposed) by the organizers, and they will be things that people keep asking for better explanations or simply are things that are "complex" and we need to document better.

➡️ To sign up to lead a poster creation group, please go look through the [Issues titled “Poster Creation”[](https://github.com/libp2p/developer-meetings/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22%5Bposter+creation+group%5D%22+) in this repo, find one you want to lead, and __assign the issue to yourself__.

## Protocol Design Sessions

One of the things that we did a lot in the first couple of years of IPFS was to really dive deep and paint the bike shed in order to come up with things such as IPLD, PubSub and other advancements to the original IPFS protocol. These design sessions were intense and they were not about explaining how things work, they were focused on finding the solution with the knowledge and resources we had available.

We want to get back to that and I want others to experience it. We have a bunch of open problems (e.g. Private DHT, scale up the DHT, reduce the information leakage on a libp2p dial, GraphSync, etc).

The output of each of these session would be a RFC like document (can be very raw) that describes the proposed solution (even if with known shortcomings).

# FAQs

### Who is this event for?  

This is a working meeting for developers and users of libp2p.  If you work on libp2p, or use it in a downstream project, you are a good fit.

### I’m already attending the [IPFS Meeting](https://github.com/ipfs/developer-meetings) earlier in the week.  Is it ok if I just stick around for the libp2p days?

This is a completely separate event from the IPFS Developers Meeting, with its own admission criteria.  If you are an active contributor to libp2p (or a downstream user of libp2p), you are absolutely welcome to attend.
